# personal-website

Hello,

I am pleased to present my personal website, which has been developed using the Django framework, Python, CSS, and HTML. 
This site serves as an online resume, showcasing some of my current projects. I will continue to update it and add new 
pages and projects as they become available. 

Update (11/25/24):
- Added index, styles, and images files to work with github.io
Update (11/26/24):
- Added support for mobile viewing

Thank you for visiting, and have a great day!
